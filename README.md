    4. Repo README has information about what you'd do next, per above requirements
        - Description of what features, functionality, etc. you would add next and how you would implement them 
        - you shouldn't spend more than a few hours on this project, so we want to know what you'd do next (and how you'd do it) if you had more time
    5. Create a new public GitHub repo and upload its url to the link you received in your test invite.

    - API can be run locally and tested using Postman or other similar tools
